## Trading Package
Core trading engine containing the heart of the system.

### Components
- **StrategyEngine** — Pluggable strategy interface: `on_bar(data) -> signals`
  - Signals: BUY/SELL/HOLD, target position, confidence (float)
  - Parameter schema + validation per strategy
- **ExecutionEngine** — Order placement and fill simulation
  - Paper mode: simulated fills, partial fills, latency, slippage, fees
  - Live mode: real order placement via CCXT (limit/market), idempotency keys
  - Order state machine: NEW -> PARTIAL -> FILLED/CANCELED/REJECTED
- **RiskManager** — Pre-trade checks and position management
  - Exposure limits, drawdown checks, daily loss limits, max position size
  - Position sizing (fixed fractional of equity)
  - Stop-loss / take-profit / trailing stop (configurable)
  - Kill-switch capability
- **Baseline Strategies** — MA Crossover, RSI Mean Reversion, Breakout (Donchian/ATR)

### Design Principles
- Spot-only for MVP (max leverage = 1)
- Deterministic backtests via seed control
- No silent failures — all errors must be logged and handled
- Fee/slippage model must be configurable (taker %, maker %, slippage bps)


### WP1.3a (exit-config validation, no-pyramiding held gate)
- `exit_config.py` is the ONE pure validator for bracket/trailing config and
  `allow_pyramiding` -- no engine/DB imports. `create_run`/`promote_to_live`/
  `resume_run` (API), `StrategyEngine.__init__`, `BacktestRunner.__init__`
  and `ParameterOptimizer.__init__` all call it; none of them may
  independently re-implement bracket/trailing parsing.
- `None`/`""`/exact `0` mean "unset" for the four bracket pct/multiplier
  fields and `trailing_stop_pct` -- EXCEPT `bracket_atr_period`, which is
  never "off" (0 is a hard 422).
- `BaseStrategy.requires_exit_manager` defaults `True` (fail-closed); every
  registry strategy declares it explicitly in its own class body, test-
  enforced. `default_allow_pyramiding` defaults `False`; only
  `DCARSIHybridStrategy`/`GridTradingStrategy` set it `True`.
- The engine's held gate (`StrategyEngine._entry_blocked_by_held_position`)
  only touches `SignalDirection.BUY`; it runs inside the step-5 per-signal
  loop, after the kill-switch/protective filter. Live pyramiding is banned
  at the API layer AND in `run_orchestrator.run_live_engine` (defence in
  depth) -- never inside `StrategyEngine` itself, so library-mechanics
  tests can still exercise two same-symbol BUYs via an explicit,
  commented `allow_pyramiding=True`.
- See `reports/vp2-wp1.3a/synthesis-spec.md` for the full bounds table
  (E1-E11, W1-W8) and the fix map.
